Harmonic Series Calculator

This calculator computes any amount of harmonics on any fundamental.
You can use this calculator for converting Hz to pitches + deviation in cents (and vice versa) as well.

A lenghty descrption of how to use it can be read on my blog:
https://www.chrenhart.eu/2021/2022/06/10/harmonic-series-calculator/

You can run this calculator either by downloading the three files (ttgen.js ; ttgen.css ; ttgen.html) to a directory >> just open the html-page.
Or you can use it directly via my website:

Purpose of this program:
This calculator is made for all those people who are into spectral music and provides a comfortable tool in order to analyse such score.
If you are a composer (such as I) you can also use it for abbreviating the process of writing spectral tables by hand.
Or if you want to know quickly, which tone a frequency of let's say 12345 Hz is (G9 minus 28 Cents, given that the standard pitch (A4) is 440 Hz >> you can also change this standard pitch easily in the calculator).

So that's it. I guess, it's quite obvious how to use it (-;
